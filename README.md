## Setup


### Client

The client uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the bundler.


pnpm can be installed globally with npm:
```
npm i -g pnpm
```

To install dependencies:
```
cd client
pnpm i
```

To start the client on a vite development server:
```
pnpm run dev
```
